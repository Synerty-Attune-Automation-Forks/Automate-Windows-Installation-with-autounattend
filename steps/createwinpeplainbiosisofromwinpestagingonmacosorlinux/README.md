The `xorriso` and `mkisofs` command is used to create a customised, 
bootable ISO image from the contents of the winpe_staging directory. 
The command includes various settings for bootability, file system types, 
naming conventions, and compatibility options to ensure the ISO functions as 
intended in various environments. 

Let's break down the command and its options:

`xorriso -as mkisofs` runs xorriso in a mode that emulates `mkisofs`, 
a linux command.

`-b boot.img` specifies boot.img as the boot image for a bootable ISO. 

`-no-emul-boot` indicates that no disk emulation mode is used for the boot 
image. This is typically used for bootable ISOs intended for systems that 
can understand the ISO file system directly.

`-c BOOT.CAT` specifies the creation of a boot catalog (BOOT.CAT) in the 
ISO image.

`-iso-level 3` sets the compliance level for the ISO 9660 standard. 
Level 3 allows for file names up to 207 characters in length and file 
sizes larger than 2 GB.

`-udf` includes UDF (Universal Disk Format) file system in 
addition to ISO 9660. UDF is often used for DVDs and newer 
optical media formats and supports larger file sizes.

`-joliet-long` Enables the use of the Joliet file system extension 
with support for longer file names.

`-relaxed-filenames` allows file names that do not strictly adhere to the 
ISO 9660 standard, providing more flexibility.

`-allow-limited-size` permits the creation of ISO images that exceed the 
size limitations of the ISO 9660 standard.

`-J` enables Joliet file system extensions for longer file names and 
Unicode characters.

`-full-iso9660-filenames` allows using the full ISO 9660 file naming 
rules without the usual length limitations.

`-disable-deep-relocation` disables the relocation of deep directory 
trees, which can be necessary for certain boot scenarios.

`-omit-version-number` omits the version number from file names in the 
ISO image.

`-V` sets the volume ID of the ISO image.

`-o` specifies the output path and filename for the created ISO image.
