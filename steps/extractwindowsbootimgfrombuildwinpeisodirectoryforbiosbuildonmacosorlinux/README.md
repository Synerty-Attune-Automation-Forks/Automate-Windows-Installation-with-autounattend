Set the shell option `nocaseglob` so that filenames will be matched regardless 
of their case.
Set the variable `F` to the list of filenames that end with 
`.iso` in the current directory.

The `isoinfo -d -i $F` command displays the details of the ISO image specified 
by `$F`. 
`grep Bootoff` filters this output to only include the line containing 
"Bootoff," which presumably contains information about the boot image offset.
`cut -c21-` extracts the characters starting from the 21st character of the 
line, which is assumed to be the offset value. 
The result is stored in the variable `OFFSET`.

The `dd` command is used for low-level copying of raw data.
`if=$F` specifies the input file, which is the ISO image.
`of=boot.img` sets the output file to `boot.img`.
`bs=2048` sets the block size to 2048 bytes. 
This is often the size of a sector in ISO9660 file systems.
`count=8` means only read 8 blocks (based on the block size).
`skip=$OFFSET` skips a number of blocks at the beginning of the input file 
before starting to copy, based on the calculated `OFFSET`.
