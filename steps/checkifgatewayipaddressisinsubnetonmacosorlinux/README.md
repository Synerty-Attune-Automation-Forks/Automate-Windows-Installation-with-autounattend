# To Debug
* Uncomment out the `echo`s to debug.


# Logic
* For loop loops through each octet in the gateway IP address, subnet range octet and subnet mask.
* For each octet:
    * The min octet is the subnet octet bitwised `AND`ed with the netmask octet.
    * A wildcard octet is 255 - netmask octet.
    * The max octet is the subnet octet bitwised `OR`ed with the wildcard octet.
    * The gateway IP address octet is tested to see if it is between the min and max octets.
