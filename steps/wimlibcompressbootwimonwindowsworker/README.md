A compressed version of `BOOT.WIM` is generated called `BOOT_CLEANED.WIM`.

Relative to the `C:\attuneautomationworker\build-{newOsNode.fqn}` folder uses `.\WinPE_amd64\media\sources\boot.wim` to generate a compressed version at `.\WinPE_amd64\sources\boot_cleaned.wim`.

This step is for both BIOS and UEFI boots.
